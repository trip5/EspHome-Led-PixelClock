# EspHome-Led-PixelClock

EHLPC is meant to be used on ESP-based MAX7219 Digit Display Clocks using ESPHome. So far, it works with an un-named Aliexpress Clock. It can probably be adapted for use with other MAX7219 Digit clocks. And, of course, it's ESPHome, so it's only limited by your imagination and skill.

A lot of inspiration is taken from the [`EHMTXv2`](https://github.com/lubeda/EspHoMaTriXv2) project... but with a monochrome LED Display.

Using this clock requires external font files.  I prefer my own [`MatrixClockFonts`](https://github.com/trip5/MatrixClockFonts) but ESPHome supports a variety of [`fonts`](https://esphome.io/components/display/index.html#fonts), including TTF.

Due to memory constraints on the ESP8266 these clocks use, I've decided to split the functions by how you may choose to use the clock.  Read below for more details.

## LED Matrix Clock

![image](./images/DotMatrixClock.jpg)

Here are a few links on Aliexpress I have personally used but I am sure there are others:
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006038630745.html & https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005704533418.html & https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006085818026.html

Here is my clock, using the Matrix Font and a bit of paper sandwiched between the LED display and the acrylic (the larger screens are a bit bright).

### Flashing

Flashing is dead-simple. Hold the 'Download' button while powering-on the clock or by pressing the reset button.

## Using This firmware

This is ESPHome, so it's not pretty but very functional.  You should set your wifi information in the YAML and edit it carefully.

If using this device on a network outside your usual, ESPHome will, after 10 seconds (set by the YAML), give up trying to connect to its "home" network and enter AP mode.
You should then connect to the hotspot (with a mobile phone) and then go to 192.168.4.1 in a browser to select which local wifi network you would like it to connect to.
The clock will display its IP address on boot and also by holding down the set button for more than 1 second. When returning home, you will have to go through this process again.
Be sure if you are using this clock as a travel clock to NOT use Home Assistant as a time source (the non-HA version uses SNTP by default).

There does appear to be some errors with "Component preferences took a long time for an operation" but it only happens when saving persistent variables to flash and doesn't seem to affect functionality, unless you try to change a variable during this moment.

### Home Assistant

Both versions of the YAML files will connect to the Home Assistant API if available.  Both can be controlled via device integration in HA.

The Non-HA version will function completely without Home Assistant and can still be controlled by accessing the WebUI via its IP or mDNS address.

### Button Functions

There's only one useable button on this clock but thanks to multi-click, we can use it for a few functions.

| Download Button      | Functionality                   | HA Version        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------|
| Short-click          | Toggle date display mode on/off | Same              |
| Double-click         | Toggle 12/24-hour mode on/off   | Same              |
| Short-click, long-press | Toggle Time Zone Offset on/off | Toggle Alt Time Zone |
| Long-press 2 seconds  | Show the clock's IP address (or other wifi status) | Toggle Time/Date Text Replacement |
| Long-press 5 seconds | Toggle the Wifi Stop Seek on/off (see below) | Toggle Auto Replacement = Alt. Time |

Of course, this is ESPHome, so you can change the button functions by editing the YAML if you wish.

### Rotation Sensor

This clock has a rotation sensor. It seems to be just a mercury-like bulb that detects if the clock has been flipped.
This is functional to flip the clock but you could also use it for other things if you wish.

### Date Display

The clock can display the date at configurable intervals.
The display interval checks how long the clock was displayed for and then displays the date for the specified time (in seconds).
Keep in mind that displaying the message from the Home Assistant integration will not interrupt this count, so I recommend choosing sane and even numbers.

### Time/Date Text Replacement

Since ESPHome can't seem to use any locale for time other than English, I have added an option to substitute the time and date text to something else.
In the text_sensors section, you can find filters that allow substitutions.

In my YAML, you will see those filters are able to localize time into Korean Hangul.  You can change this to anything you like.
Be sure that the text to be substituted matches the output of strftime (which will be the default) and be sure to make sure any characters you need are included in the glyphs section,
or those special characters will not be displayed!

There is also an option called Replacement Interval by which you can make your clock bilingual. It will automatically turn on/off the substitution every number of times the date is displayed, if the date is displayed.  If the date display is off, the automatic replacement will be made after the time specified by Date Display Time (multiplied by the Date Display Interval).

![image](./images/Korean-demo.gif)

Check the language_filters folder for some examples.  So far there is:
[`Korean`](language_filters/Korean.yaml) &
[`French`](language_filters/French.yaml) &
[`Greek`](language_filters/Greek.yaml) &
[`Chinese`](language_filters/Chinese.yaml)

Hopefully OnlineGDB hosts this [`Glyphs Helper`](https://www.onlinegdb.com/fork/zh1VszNT1) for a long while. See inside the yaml for more.

### Time Sync

Time can be synced to the Internet at configurable intervals between 1 - 24 hours, provided the wifi network is connected.

## Non-HA Version

The file [`EHLPClock.yaml`](EHLPClock.yaml) contains functions useful for using the clock as... mostly just a clock but with some power-saving functions.
It includes all of the functions above as well as these below.  This version has a WebUI which can be accessed via it's IP after connecting the clock to Wifi.
So if you need a travel clock, this may be the ideal one for you.  It can still be controlled by Home Assistant as well but is not dependent on it to function.

### Time Zone Offset

It's up to you how to handle time offset.  It will affect the main time zone as well as the alternate time zone
You can set an offset with a number that is a positive or negative value with decimal places (ie. 2, -2, 12.5).

I have allowed steps of 0.25 (equal to 15 minutes) but I notice ESPHome does not enforce those steps. It is possible to set an offset like 0.01 (which would be 36 seconds).
Be careful.

### Wifi Stop Seek

This is disabled by default but by turning it on, the clock will disable its wifi radio after a configurable time if the network connection is dropped.
Note that this does not turn wifi off if connected, it's merely a timeout for when the configured wifi connection cannot be made. 
This is meant as a power-saving feature in the event of a power blackout.

Under normal conditions, when an ESPHome device loses wifi connectivity, it will continuously seek out a wifi connection or activate a hotspot to allow configuring a wifi connection.
While in this non-connected state, the clock will use more power than usual. If you have a coin-cell battery that maintains the RTC during a blackout,
you could re-connect the clock to a powerbank or some other power source and it will continue to function.

Please note that this also means that the clock will not try to connect to wifi again (this will be indicated on the screen as "Wifi Off" when long-pressing the button),
unless you reset the power, which just means unplugging it and plugging it back in again.

Do not set this time too short.  I have allowed 60 seconds minimum in the options but this could mean your clock stops trying to connect to wifi just because
your router rebooted or the wifi was a bit sketchy. The default is 120 seconds which I think is enough time for even the slowest router to reboot, but it's your choice.
Also keep in mind that this time will affect how long the configuration hotspot is available for.
The hotspot will activate after 10 seconds (lowered from 60 seconds which is ESPHome default).

You can enable or disable this mode by holding the button for 5 seconds to toggle the function. The wifi will be turned on again if it has been turned off.

### Display Off

There are two options to turn off the display. One is to turn off the display after a configurable time when the clock is not being used (in minutes).
The other is to turn off the display when there is no Wifi connection (in seconds).  The display may be turned on again by pressing the button.

### Power Consumption

*Small Red LED, 2024.11.11 Version, 1 hour each mode, measured with a FNIRSI FNB-58 powered externally*

| Status: Modes                                        | Power usage |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Connected: Display On - Brightness 14                | 481.44 mAh  |
| Connected: Display On - Brightness 0                 | 112.50 mAh  |
| Connected: Display Off after 5 min                   | 99.78 mAh   |
| No Wifi: Stop Seek Off & Display On - Brightness 0   | 118.33 mAh  |
| No Wifi: Stop Seek On & Display On - Brightness 0    | 63.72 mAh  |
| No Wifi: Stop Seek On & Display Off after 30 sec     | 50.04 mAh  |

*Note: On this clock, Brightness 0 is still very visible. For the display to turn off, the display is cleared which should have the same effect.*

#### What Does This Mean?

On maximum power savings, you could power the clock from a 5000mAh powerbank for around 4 days: `5000mAh / 51mA â‰ˆ 98 hours`!

### LED Output

While the clock is attempting to connect to wifi or while in hotspot mode, the blue LED will pulse on and off every 1 second.

If Stop Seek is enabled, then the LED will fade on or off every 2 seconds during connection attempts.

If connected to Wifi or Stop Seek has activated, the LED will turn off completely.

### Special Note Regarding the WebUI's Internet Dependence

ESPHome devices usually rely on the Internet to be available to access a Javascript file that formats the web UI.
Specifically, the device will look for https://oi.esphome.io/v2/www.js but this file can be made available on-device with this included in the `webserver:` section.
This is added to the non-HA version by default.

```yaml
  local: true
```
If you don't mind the device's WebUI being dependent on the Internet, you could remove this line.
You could consider hosting the file on another machine in-house, too by using something like:
```yaml
  js_include: ""
  js_url: "http://192.168.1.1/esphome-www/www.js"
```
Please note that for some reason, I'm not sure that the UI can be viewed from an Chrome-based mobile browser. Maybe my phone has an issue.
It seems to work fine when viewing on a computer or an Apple phone. If you have information to share, I'd be glad to know why this is.

## Home Assistant Version

The file [`EHLPClock-HA.yaml`](EHLPClock-HA.yaml) contains functions useful for using the clock with Home Assistant.
It does not include the WebUI, Time Zone Offset, Wifi Stop Seek, or Display Off but it does includes all of the functions below.

### Alternate Time Zone

This option is to allow displaying a Time Zone other than your "home" time zone.  It can be activated permanently or by using the "Auto Replacement = Alt. Time" mode.
This allows you to see your home time zone and an alternate time zone in another language.  Now your clock is a bilingual time-traveler!

Please note that the time zones MUST be in POSIX format instead of the usual Olsen type (`Asia/Seoul`).

POSIX formats look like: `KST-9` or `PST8PDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00` or `AST4ADT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`.

They include daylight savings and time-switches in the formatting. So, there is no reliance on the ESPHome Olsen database to be current.
You can view a lot of the time zones in the world in POSIX format [`here`](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.csv) or
[`here`](https://support.cyberdata.net/portal/en/kb/articles/010d63c0cfce3676151e1f2d5442e311).
If you need to make a custom POSIX format you can look [`here`](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/au-aix-posix/) or even better, use this

### Service Call

![image](./images/EHLPC_Home_Assistant_message.png)

This example will send a message that will display for 3 seconds before reverting to the clock for 5 seconds, and repeat until 20 seconds is finished (if it is displaying the message, it will finish that last 3 seconds). It may interrupt any screen currently being displayed and will return to it after the display time is finished, show the clock/date screen for the specified time, and repeat until the alive time is finished (which includes both the service screen and clock/date screens).  Everything is measured in seconds.

### Template Sensors

This will allow the clock to display information screens, following a single interval of clock and date screens.  You can display all screens at once or one per interval.
They are all treated as sensors, similarly as my [ESPHome-eInk-Boards](https://github.com/trip5/ESPHome-eInk-Boards) projects.

Put something like this in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template: !include template.yaml
```

Anything in `configuration.yaml` under the `template:` heading must now be moved to `template.yaml`. Take a quick look [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-do-i-setup-template-trigger-sensor-in-a-splitting-config/718626/) for some examples on an easy way to format `template.yaml`.

The file [`template.yaml`](template.yaml) contains several examples how to add sensors that can be automatically shown by the clock.
I personally use only one sensor in my Home Assistant and 2 clocks in the house get data from the same sensor but you can (of course) create a sensor for each individual clock.

## Crashes?

The memory of the ESP8266 on this clock is extremely limited. With these default yamls, I've found the devices often crash just when doing an OTA update.
So I usually flash via USB cable.  To save memory, it is probably a good idea to limit the number of characters you include in the glyphs section to only necessary characters.

If your clock is constantly crashing, you can first try eliminating the message_font (read the notes in the yaml). 
Then, add this to you sensor section and check how much free memory the ESP has to work with.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "ESP Free Heap"
    lambda: |-
      int heap = ESP.getFreeHeap();
      return heap / 1024.0;
    unit_of_measurement: "kB"
    update_interval: 5s
    entity_category: diagnostic
    icon: mdi:chip
```
I've found anything below 8kB available to the heap can cause constant crashes.

## Tasmota Notes

Some people would prefer to use Tasmota.  I did use Tasmota at first but I found it a bit lacking, namely that it doesn't seem possible to replace the default font.  I made some notes that I'll include here:

First, using [`Gitpod`](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/master), add these lines to user_config_override.h:
```cpp
#define USE_DISPLAY_MAX7219_MATRIX
#define USE_I2C
#define USE_DS3231
#define USE_RTC_CHIPS
```

Then run:
```
platformio run -e tasmota-display
```

The GPIOs:
| Function | PIN  |
| -------- | ---- |
| SCL  | GPIO4  |
| SDA  | GPIO5  |
| CLK  | GPIO14 |
| MOSI | GPIO13 |
| CS   | GPIO15 |
| LEDLINK | GPIO2 |
| SWITCH 1 (Download button) | GPIO0 |
| SWITCH 2 (Rotation Sensor) | GPIO16 |

Some useful console commands (it'll at least get you a functional display, though you may need to reset the power first):
```
Backlog DisplayWidth 32; DisplayHeight 8; DisplayModel 19; DisplayMode 0; DisplayRotate 1

Backlog Power 1; DisplayClock 1
```

### Repair

My Blue LED Clock had a dim pixel and a dead pixel on 2 separate sections of the matrix.  The LED matrixes are 8x8 pixels using a common cathode.

The larger clocks use a 1088AB which can be found on Aliexpress here: https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005007029570407.html

The smaller clocks use 788AB (788AS?) which can be found from the same seller here: https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005007029678274.html

Unfortunately it seems they can only be bought in bulk of 10 to 100 quantity... I've ordered the red-colored ones (both types) and I can confirm they work.

Be sure to get the CC models only and do not get the mixed color models as they have more pins.
